I learned that it doesn't make much sense to create a sinuous-specific
bundle, for a couple of reasons:

1. The size of sinuous alone is 5k, and credt is about 1k. We might as
   well combine these two, if we're going to take advantage of any
   kind of latency (bandwidth is not a concern at these sizes).

2. There are a lot of moving parts involved, and if we're going to
   bundle at all, we might as well move the parts just once. For
   example, patch, chomp, esbuild, and a custom js file to bring it
   all together.
