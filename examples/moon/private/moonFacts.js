  "Moon Basics":
    "The moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is airless, waterless, " +
    "and devoid of life. Its surface is pockmarked with billions of years " +
    "of asteroid impacts, creating a dramatic lunar landscape of craters, " +
    "mountains, and vast flat areas (maria). Its gravity is just one-sixth " +
    "of Earth's, an aspect that would dramatically alter everyday life for lunar inhabitants.",

  "Moon Geology":
    "Predominantly composed of silicate minerals, the Moon's crust holds " +
    "a record of its violent history. It also holds helium-3, a potential fuel " +
    "for future nuclear fusion power. Lunar soil, or regolith, is a gritty dust layer " +
    "that could be used as a raw material for construction, manufacturing, " +
    "or even as a source for extracting water.",

  "Habitability":
    "The moon is harsh. Its day lasts for 14 Earth days, followed by a 14-day night. " +
    "Daytime temperatures can soar over 100°C, and nights can plunge below -170°C. " +
    "Lunar inhabitants would have to deal with constant temperature swings, " +
    "near-zero atmospheric pressure, and damaging solar and cosmic radiation.",

  "Human History":
    "Humans have been fascinated by the moon for millennia. The Apollo missions " +
    "of the 1960s and '70s were humanity's first physical explorations, " +
    "with Apollo 11 marking the first manned moon landing in 1969. " +
    "Since then, various nations and private entities have been developing " +
    "plans to return, aiming for lunar bases, scientific exploration, and even tourism.",

  "Future Exploration":
    "The moon is seen as a stepping stone for further space exploration. " +
    "Living on the moon would require us to develop new technologies " +
    "and methods for survival, many of which could be applied to future interplanetary journeys. " +
    "Its proximity makes it an ideal testbed for these advancements.",

  "Societal Impact":
    "Establishing a human presence on the moon raises numerous philosophical, " +
    "ethical, and societal questions. Who gets to claim lunar resources? " +
    "What happens if a lunar colony declares independence? " +
    "These topics could provide compelling conflicts for a science fiction novel.",
